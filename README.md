# Unlimited Vaults

A Minecraft Paper plugin that allows players to use trial and aminous vaults as many times as they'd like. After a player uses a vault, there is a set amount of time the plugin waits before it can be used again.


## Installation 
- Download the latest release from my github
- Paste the .jar plugin file in your /Plugins folder and restart your server
- A new folder will be made with a config.yml file where you can change the wait time between uses


## Future Updates 
- Ability to set a specific amount of uses per player
